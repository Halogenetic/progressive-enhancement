    Story of the Chinese Farmer

<blockquote><p><q>it a good thing? Is that a bad thing? I don't know.</q> 
    May 11, 2016, Alexandre Gorius <br/><br/>
    In nature, Good & Evil do not exist. The Universe itself is neither good nor bad, but a potential in permanent development.

<blockquote><p class="bold-p">Up in space, turning around, looking at the earth’s face. <br/>
    From that rock’s perspective on Mars or that gaz opinion from Jupiter, nothing cares about your problems. <br/>
    Up there, it’s just not serious, and there’s no such thing as an issue. <br/>
    Down here, the only reality is the one inside our brain. <br/>
    Nothing exists if the brain doesn’t think it. <br/>
    Nothing exists neither if our senses don’t transmit the message. <br/>
    That means that if we mis sense, our reality changes. <br/>
    That’s possible because our perception is limited : you can’t see at 360 degrees for example. <br/>
    If we mis translate the message, our reality changes. <br/>
    If we think it in a way, our reality changes depending on that way. <br/>
    Therefore, if we can change reality that much, everything’s fake. <br/>
    They’re proofs to that. <br/>
    Fall in love with someone and you’ll see that person as divine. <br/>
    Pull yourself out of that grip and the divine falls from clouds to solid ground, revealing him or herself differently. <br/>
    But the person is the same, you just changed your mind. <br/>
    Everything works like that : it’s not just that you can make your world, it’s that you passively do it anyway.

<blockquote><p>
    Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. <br/>
    That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. <br/>
    They said, <q class="vi">We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away.This is most unfortunate. </q> farmer said, <q class="fa">Is it <q class="good">good</q>? Is it <q class="bad">bad</q>? I don't know.</q> <br/>
    The next dayv the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said, <q class="vi">Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses! </q><br/>
    The farmer again said, <q class="fa">Is it <q class="good">good</q>? Is it <q class="bad">bad</q>? I don't know. </q><br/>
    The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. <br/>
    The neighbors then said, <q class="vi">Oh dear, that’s too <q class="bad">bad</q>, </q> the farmer responded, <q class="fa">Is it <q class="good">good</q>? Is it <q class="bad">bad</q>? I don't know.</q><br/> 
    The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said, <q class="vi">Isn’t that great!</q> Again, he said, <q class="fa">Is it <q class="good">good</q>? Is it <q class="bad">bad</q>? I don't know.</q><br/><br/>
    The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is <q class="good">good</q> or <q class="bad">bad</q> — because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of good fortune. <br/>

<h2>Conclusion  </h2>
<p>
    <span class="good">Good</span> and <span class="bad">Bad</span> are just one perspective. <br/>
Bananas are good for monkeys, but monkeys are not good for bananas. <br/>
Let's not make a big deal out of it...
